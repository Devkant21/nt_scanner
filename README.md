Network Scanner

- network_scan.py
- **Network Scan** conducts a network scan on a specified target IP address. It utilizes the scapy module for crafting and sending packets. First, it sends an ICMP echo request (ping) to determine if the target is online. If online, it scans common TCP ports using SYN packets and identifies open ports. For each port, it sends a TCP SYN packet and waits for a response. If a response is received and it has a TCP layer with SYN-ACK flags, it identifies the port as open. The program reports results and errors accordingly, providing a simple yet effective network scanning tool.

- ip_address.py
- **IP_Address**retrieves the local machine's IP address using the socket module. It first gets the hostname of the machine using socket.gethostname(), then resolves it to an IP address using socket.gethostbyname(). If successful, it returns the IP address. If an error occurs, such as if the hostname cannot be resolved, it catches the socket.gaierror exception and prints an error message. When executed as the main program, it calls the get_ip_address() function and prints the retrieved IP address. This provides a simple method to obtain the local machine's IP address, which can be useful in network-related applications.

- port_scan.py
- **Port_scan** performs port scanning on a specified target IP address. It utilizes the socket module to create TCP socket connections to potential ports. For each port in a predefined list of common ports, it attempts to connect to the target IP. If the connection is successful (result code 0), it indicates that the port is open. Otherwise, it concludes that the port is either closed or filtered. The script handles socket errors gracefully and provides feedback on each port's status. When executed, it prompts the user to input the target IP address and then initiates the port scanning process, providing valuable insights into the target's network accessibility.
